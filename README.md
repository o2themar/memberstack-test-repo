# Memberstack GitHub Pages Demo

A minimal static demo to test Memberstack on GitHub Pages.

How to use:
1. Replace the placeholder Memberstack script in `index.html` with your install script (Memberstack Dashboard → Settings → Install Code).
2. (Optional) Replace `PLAN_ID` with a real plan id if you want to test plan-related flows.
3. Push this repo to GitHub.
4. Enable GitHub Pages in the repo settings (branch: `main` / folder: `/root`) or create a `gh-pages` branch.
5. Visit the published URL and test signup/login/profile flows. Keep Memberstack in Test Mode while testing.
